<em>Last Updated: 2016-08-23</em>

### Definitions

Pnut.io and the pnut API website and services will be referred to as "Service" and "we". These terms of service will be referred to as "Terms".



### Content

You the text and media that you submit to The Service. We are given legal permission to retain your content insomuch as you are responsible for removing said content. You are also held liable for any illegal content created on or illegal use of the Service through your account.

#### Pseudonyms

Allowed. Any payments made may require real names to be associated with payment information.

#### Deletion, Suspension

The Service will make due diligence to completely delete your content within two weeks of any request to delete an account.

Your account may be suspended without warning if deemed a threat to others or to the Service's maintenance and upkeep. If you are concerned about what might constitute a threat, talk to Support. Suspension can be reversed. Offensive or particularly sensitive content should be marked as "Not Safe For Work" ("NSFW") to reduce complaints.


### Performance

We make no guarantees of uptime or delivery of services. Performance and functionality will vary across geographies, and this is a small service maintained by a small team.


### Governments

The Service will redirect government or law enforcement requests for removal or revelation of details forward to any user directly. We retain a history of your account, but logs of IP addresses and other identifying data are periodically removed.



### Acceptance of Terms

If you access or use the Service, it means you agree to be bound by all of the terms. If you do not agree to the Terms, please do not use the Service. If a term does not make sense to you, contact Support.

#### Changes

These Terms will be maintained along with previous versions <a href="https://github.com/pnut-api/tos">on GitHub</a>. No other notice may be given on changes, unless they are deemed to be significant, in which case we will attempt to give two weeks' notice, and send an E-mail to each account address, unless that account has opted-out of notifications. Please submit any concerns or requests for change as issues <a href="https://github.com/pnut-api/tos">on GitHub</a>, or via E-mail to <a href="mailto:support@pnut.io">support@pnut.io</a>.

If you continue to use the Service after the revised Terms go into effect, then you have accepted the revised Terms.
